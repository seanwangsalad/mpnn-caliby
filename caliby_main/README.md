# Caliby
Official repository for Caliby, a Potts model-based protein sequence design method that can condition on structural ensembles. For more details, read our preprint: [Ensemble-conditioned protein sequence design with Caliby](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.30.679633v4)

This repository contains code for sequence design, ensemble generation with Protpardelle-1c, ensemble-conditioned sequence design, and sequence scoring.

Both this repository and Caliby are still under active development, so please reach out if you have any questions or feature requests! To re-train Caliby, training and dataset preprocessing code should mostly be provided within this repository, but we plan to update in the future with more detailed instructions.

# Installation
Follow the below instructions for setting up the environment. After you've installed the environment, edit `env_setup.sh` to point to your environment directory, and run `source env_setup.sh` before running any scripts (see example scripts in `examples/scripts`).

## Option 1: uv installation (preferred)
To run the scripts in this repository, we recommend using `uv` for package management. If you don't already have `uv` installed, follow the official installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods).

Then, run the following commands to install the dependencies:
```
# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/ProteinDesignLab/caliby.git
cd caliby

# Create and activate the environment.
ENV_DIR=envs  # or any other directory of your choice
mkdir -p ${ENV_DIR}
uv venv ${ENV_DIR}/caliby -p python3.12
source ${ENV_DIR}/caliby/bin/activate

# Install Caliby from the local checkout.
uv pip install -e .
```

Or install directly from GitHub without cloning:
```bash
uv pip install "git+https://github.com/ProteinDesignLab/caliby.git"
```

## Option 2: Apptainer installation
If the above workflow does not work for you, and you instead need to run Caliby within an Apptainer container, first set `ENV_DIR` and `IMG` in `build_apptainer.sh` to the directory you want to use for the environment and the image path, respectively. Then, you can run `./build_apptainer.sh` to download the container and install the environment within the container

After the setting up the container and environment, you can run Caliby scripts within the container by wrapping the script in `apptainer exec --nv`. For example, to run `examples/scripts/seq_des.sh` within the container, you can run:
```
IMG=${PWD}/containers/pytorch_24.12.sif
apptainer exec --nv \
  ${IMG} \
  bash -lc '
  source env_setup.sh
  ./examples/scripts/seq_des.sh
'
```

## Download model weights
Model weights are hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ProteinDesignLab/caliby-weights). Weights are **automatically downloaded** on first run, so you can skip this step if you prefer. To pre-download all weights at once, run:
```
./download_model_params.sh
```
This will download the weights into the `model_params/` directory (configurable via `MODEL_PARAMS_DIR` in `env_setup.sh`). These weights include the Caliby models, ProteinMPNN, and the Protpardelle-1c model.

We offer the following model checkpoints, specified via the `ckpt_name_or_path` argument:

**Sequence design:**

| Model | `ckpt_name_or_path` | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Caliby | `caliby` (default) | Default model trained on all chains in the PDB with 0.3Å Gaussian noise. Trained on monomers only. |
| SolubleCaliby | `soluble_caliby` | Analog to SolubleMPNN ([Goverde et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07601-y)) trained by excluding all annotated transmembrane proteins. Trained on monomers only. |
| SolubleCaliby v1 | `solublecaliby_v1` | SolubleCaliby trained on both monomers and interfaces |

**Sidechain packing:**

| Model | `ckpt_name_or_path` | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Caliby packer (0.0Å) | `caliby_packer_000` | Sidechain packer trained with 0.0Å noise |
| Caliby packer (0.1Å) | `caliby_packer_010` | Sidechain packer trained with 0.1Å noise (recommended for most cases)|
| Caliby packer (0.3Å) | `caliby_packer_030` | Sidechain packer trained with 0.3Å noise |

If `ckpt_name_or_path` does not end with `.ckpt`, it is treated as a model name and automatically resolved and downloaded. If it ends with `.ckpt`, it is treated as a file path (e.g., `ckpt_name_or_path=/path/to/custom_model.ckpt`).

# Usage

## Sequence design
To design sequences for a set of PDBs, see `examples/scripts/seq_des.sh`. This script takes in a `input_cfg.pdb_dir` and will design sequences for all PDBs in the directory.

To design sequences for a subset of PDBs within the directory, see `examples/scripts/seq_des_subset.sh`. This script takes in a `input_cfg.pdb_dir` and a `input_cfg.pdb_name_list` (a list of filenames with extensions to use from the directory) and will design sequences for the PDBs specified in the list.

## Backbone ensemble generation with Protpardelle-1c
We found that instead of designing on a static structure, running sequence design on *synthetic ensembles* generated by Protpardelle-1c partial dfifusion produces sequences that are both more diverse and more likely to be predicted by AlphaFold2 to fold into the target structure. To generate ensembles with Protpardelle-1c in a format compatible with Caliby, we have provided a script in `examples/scripts/generate_ensembles.sh`.

For each PDB provided in `input_cfg.pdb_dir`, this script will generate `num_samples_per_pdb` samples per PDB with Protpardelle-1c partial diffusion. For ensemble-conditioned sequence design, we recommend generating at least 32 samples per PDB, but 16 or 8 samples can also give good results.

## Ensemble-conditioned sequence design
### Sequence design with synthetic Protpardelle-1c ensembles
After you've generated ensembles with Protpardelle-1c, you can run ensemble-conditioned sequence design with `examples/scripts/seq_des_ensemble.sh`, which will run ensemble-conditioned sequence design on all ensembles in `input_cfg.conformer_dir`. You can use `examples/scripts/seq_des_ensemble_subset.sh` to run on a subset of the ensembles by providing a `input_cfg.pdb_name_list` file.

### Providing your own ensembles
The Protpardelle-1c ensemble generation script described above will produce a directory structure that is compatible with the `seq_des_ensemble.sh` script, but if you want to provide your own ensembles, you should format your ensembles as described below.

Given a top-level directory passed into the `seq_des_ensemble.sh` script (e.g., `cc95-epoch3490-sampling_partial_diffusion-ss1.0-schurn0-ccstart0.0-dx0.0-dy0.0-dz0.0-rewind150`), each subdirectory is named `<PDB_KEY>`, representing one ensemble. Inside each ensemble subdirectory, the following files are expected:
  - **Primary conformer**: The original structure file (identified by `<PDB_KEY>.pdb` or `<PDB_KEY>.cif`) serving as the default representative conformer and is always included in the ensemble by default.
  - **Additional conformers**: All other `.pdb` or `.cif` files in the directory are treated as conformer files, which will be ordered by their natural alphabetical order with python's `natsort` library.

The sequence design script takes in a `max_num_conformers` argument, which defaults to 32 and will be used to determine the maximum number of conformers to include in the ensemble. By default, the primary conformer will always be included in the ensemble. Then, we choose additional conformers, in order, until we have `max_num_conformers` conformers in the ensemble or we run out of conformers. We recommend using 32 conformers, but 8 or 16 conformers can also give good results.

## Scoring
All sequence design scripts automatically save the global energy of the sequences they design in the resulting `seq_des_outputs.csv` file. Additionally, Caliby can score sequences on a set of input PDBs via `examples/scripts/score.sh`. This will produce a `score_outputs.csv` file that contains a column `U`, which is the energy computed from the Potts model.

You can also score a sequence against an ensemble of backbones via `examples/scripts/score_ensemble.sh`, where the ensembles should be provided in the same format as described in the previous section. When scoring a sequence against an ensemble, the sequence corresponding to the primary conformer will be scored, and the sequences of the additional conformers will be ignored.

Potts quantities are stored in a reduced alphabet defined by `const.POTTS_TOKENS`, rather than the full AF3 token vocabulary. In particular, if you save Potts parameters via `++sampling_cfg_overrides.save_potts_params=true`, the saved `h` and `J` tensors use `C = len(const.POTTS_TOKENS)` states. Likewise, when scoring proteins, `save_local_conditionals=true` saves `.npy` files of shape `(N, C)` for each scored example, where `C = len(const.POTTS_TOKENS)` and the final axis should be interpreted with `const.POTTS_TOKENS`.

## Additional sequence design options

All sequence design options can be found in `caliby/configs/seq_des/atom_mpnn_inference.yaml`. These options can be overridden from `seq_des.sh` and `seq_des_ensemble.sh` via the `sampling_cfg_overrides` argument using hydra override syntax, e.g. `++sampling_cfg_overrides.omit_aas=["C"]` or `++sampling_cfg_overrides.potts_sampling_cfg.potts_sweeps=5000`.

### Globally omit certain amino acids
Caliby can omit certain amino acids from design via the `omit_aas` argument. This should be specified as a list of amino acids to omit, e.g. `["C", "G"]`.

### Position-wise constraints
Caliby also supports applying various constraints on certain residues, specified via the `pos_constraint_csv` argument. This CSV should contain a `pdb_key` column denoting which PDB the constraints should apply to, and a subset of columns in `["fixed_pos_seq", "fixed_pos_scn", "fixed_pos_override_seq", "pos_restrict_aatype"]`.

| Column name | Format example | Description |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| `pdb_key` | `8xhz` | The PDB file stem (filename without extension) to apply the constraints to. For ensemble-conditioned sequence design, `pdb_key` should be the name of the ensemble subdirectory. |
| `fixed_pos_seq` | `A1-100,B1-100` | Sequence positions in the input PDB to condition on so that they remain fixed during design. For ensemble-conditioned design, `fixed_pos_seq` is applied using the primary conformer's sequence. |
| `fixed_pos_scn` | `A1-10,A12,A15-20` | Sidechain positions in the input PDB to condition on so that they remain fixed during design. Note that fixed sidechain positions must be a subset of fixed sequence positions, since it does not make sense to condition on a sidechain without also conditioning on its sequence identity.|
| `fixed_pos_override_seq` | `A26:A,A27:L` | Sequence positions in the input PDB to first override the sequence at, and then condition on. The colon separates the position and the desired amino acid.|
| `pos_restrict_aatype` | `A26:AVG,A27:VG` | Allowed amino acids for certain positions in the input PDB. The colon separates the position and the allowed amino acids.|
| `symmetry_pos` | `A10,B10,C10\|A11,B11,C11` | Symmetry positions for tying sampling across residue positions. The pipe separates groups of positions to sample symmetrically. In the example, A10, B10, and C10 are tied together, and A11, B11, and C11 are tied together. |

If `pos_constraint_csv` is not provided, Caliby will redesign all positions. If a column is not present in the CSV, Caliby will not apply any constraints for that column. If a particular column is included in the CSV, but its value for the `pdb_key` at that row is empty, Caliby will not apply that constraint for that PDB.

For an example constraint CSV file, see `examples/example_data/pos_constraint_csvs/native_pdb_constraints.csv`. For example usage, see `examples/scripts/seq_des_constraints.sh` and `examples/scripts/seq_des_ensemble_constraints.sh`.

In general, residue index positions should be specified by the `label_seq_id` column, *not the `auth_seq_id` column*. To view positions of the sequence using the `label_seq_id` in PyMOL, you can run `set cif_use_auth, off` in PyMOL before loading in the PDB file.

### Specifying symmetry positions
Caliby supports specifying symmetry positions for tying sampling across residue positions. This is specified via the `symmetry_pos` column in the `pos_constraint_csv` file. For an example of a symmetry position CSV file, see `examples/example_data/pos_constraint_csvs/homooligomer_constraints.csv`.

For example usage in sequence design and ensemble generation, see the scripts under the `examples/scripts/homooligomers` directory. We also provide a script to quickly generate a symmetry_pos entry for a homooligomer at `examples/scripts/homooligomers/make_homooligomer_symmetry_pos.sh`, which can be used to print out a symmetry_pos entry by specifying chain IDs and residue ranges.

## Sidechain packing
Caliby supports sidechain packing via a diffusion-based sidechain packing module. Given a backbone structure and sequence, the packer predicts sidechain coordinates by denoising in a local backbone frame.

To run sidechain packing, see `examples/scripts/sidechain_pack.sh`. This script takes in a `input_cfg.pdb_dir` and will pack sidechains for all PDBs in the directory, saving the packed structures as CIF files. You can configure the number of diffusion steps and step scale via `sampling_cfg_overrides`.

## Self-consistency evaluation with AlphaFold2
This repository can evaluate designed sequences by predicting their structures with single-sequence AlphaFold2 and comparing against the design input. This produces metrics including scRMSD (CA RMSD between designed and predicted structures), average CA pLDDT, and TM-score.

To run self-consistency evaluation, first install the AF2 dependencies:
```
uv pip install -e ".[af2]"
```

Then, add `run_self_consistency_eval=true` to any sequence design command (`seq_des.py` or `seq_des_ensemble.py`). For an example with ensemble-conditioned design, see `examples/scripts/seq_des_and_refold.sh`. This will run sequence design, predict the designed sequences with AF2, and save self-consistency metrics to `self_consistency_metrics.csv` in the output directory.

# FAQs

### I encountered a "Residue index / chain ID mismatch between decoys" error when running ensemble-conditioned sequence design. How do I fix this?

When running ensemble-conditioned sequence design, Caliby requires that the residue indices / chain IDs of the decoys are aligned with the residue indices / chain IDs of the primary conformer. Otherwise, a misalignment could occur when aggregating Potts model parameters across the decoys, which would silently yield poor results. We recommend examining the decoys to ensure all residues line up correctly. If this occurred with a Protpardelle-generated ensemble, this was likely due to inconsistent handling of ignored residues between Protpardelle and Caliby. For this case, we provide a script in `examples/scripts/clean_pdbs.sh` that you can run to clean your PDB file before ensemble generation to ensure that the resulting ensembles are aligned correctly.
